# PRF_PLAY

This repo will be used for me to become more proficient at working with prf data/ analyses. It will consist of several notebooks. In these notebooks I will work with the data from this article https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219304105. Note that this dataset consists of very many sessions. Therefore, I will be focusing on just a subset of this data. 


## Notebooks


# Index
| Notebook | Phase | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Data_prelim](/Data_prelim.ipynb) | 1 | This is an initial inspection of the data from the Van Es cerebellum paper. |
| [POPEYENB](/POPEYENB.ipynb) | 2 | This is my exploration of the popeye API - a package for fitting prf models.|
| [Post-fmriprep](/Post-fmriprep.ipynb) | 3 |  These are further stages of pre-processing after a call to fmriprep. |
| [Model fitting](/Model-fitting.ipynb). | 4 | The model fitting itself themselves. |
| [SURFACE_PLAY](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/N-HEDGER/PRF_PLAYN/blob/master/SURFACE_PLAY_NILEARN.ipynb). | 4 | Here I start trying to understand surface-based data using NILEARN(view with nbviewer for 3d surface plots) |
| [Surface pre-processing](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/N-HEDGER/PRF_PLAYN/blob/master/SURFACE_PRE_PROCESS.ipynb) | 5 | Pre-processing the surface data |
| [Format](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/N-HEDGER/PRF_PLAYN/blob/master/Pickle2csv.ipynb) | 6 | (after fitting the models on the cluster (see jobscripts folder) Formatting of the model fits and some initial presentations (view with nbviewer for 3d surface plots)|
| [Model presentation](https://n-hedger.github.io/PRF_PLAYN/Prf_pres.html) | 7 | Presenting the models. |
